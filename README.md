# Address Formatter


## Calling a JSON API

This program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON from the web service and parse that 
data, and retrieve the formatted address from the JSON.


## API End Points

[API endpoint](http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json?) that has a static subset of the Google Data.

This API uses the same parameter (address) as the Google API. This API also has no rate limit, so you can test as often
as you like.


## AND

If you have a Google Places API key, paste that in the code, and then experience the **MAGIC** :)
